      <p>My name is Kevin Halstead and I am currently working as city route planner for Estes Express Lines in Aurora, Colorado. I am a former dock supervisor as well as line haul driver for Estes. I am aspiring to become a web devoloper and am currently taking the DU coding bootcamp in Denver, Colorado. After having a health scare in October 2018, I was unable to continue my job as a CDL truck driver and now am looking forward to the possiblities that being a web devoloper will bring to myself and family. I am happily married to the love of my life and high school sweetheart, Dasha Halstead. We have 3 beautiful childern together, Nehemiah age 10, Uriyah age 8, and Gabriel age 4.</p>
